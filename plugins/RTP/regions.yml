default:

    #shape of bounds
    # CIRCLE, SQUARE - spiral curves
    shape: "CIRCLE"
    #what selection adjustment method to use
    # ACCUMULATE - accumulate all bad sectors up to the initial selection (even distribution, slow at large radii)
    # NEAREST - try nearest non-hit (possible clustering, but fast)
    # REROLL - reroll early on a known hit (even distribution, non-deterministic time, but still fast)
    # NONE - don't check if it's a known hit, just load and try (best for massive radii, >50k)
